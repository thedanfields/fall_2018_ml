Car experiments
1. accuracy on each classification (vgood, good, acc, unacc)
2. accuracy on all classifications

Observations:
* It looks like more depth is needed to become more accurate on smaller sample sizes.
* Boosting takes a bit more time, but works much better.
* Neural networks have high scores but are inaccurate

** Need to obtain error rates to show overfitting!
